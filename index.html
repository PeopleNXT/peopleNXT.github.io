<p>PeopleNXT is a community by and for (HR) Leaders who want to explore, share and learn what the future holds for human resource management. We are about reinventing HR and repositioning HR as a strategic business partner.</p>

<p>PeopleNXT organises events and hosts an interactive online community. By doing so we want to provide a community where you can share your thoughts, knowledge and experiences and in return, learn the same from the other members.</p>

<p>Several times a year we collaborate with leading thinkers and doers to organise inspiring, informal and interactive <a href="./events.html">events</a>. At these events we will engage with ideas and each other so that we can all learn about the future of HR. Furthermore the <a href="./community.html">online community</a> provides an exceptional way to interact, take the discussion further and take action. The people in our community are people with an open mind and a strong opinion.  The content is a perfect match between science and theory on the one hand and real life and day-to-day operations on the other hand.</p>

<p>Don't wait for the future, the future is now! <a href="./apply.html">Join</a> the PeopleNXT community!</p>
